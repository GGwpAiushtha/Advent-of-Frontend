# Brief

In this project, we're creating a YouTube Video Gallery.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

**Users should be able to:**

- view title, description, and embed of featured video from the channel
- view gallery of title and thumbnails for other videos

## **Need some support on this challenge?**

- Upgrade to the [Solution Tier](http://adventofcss.com). You'll get a video explanation from Amy.
- Join the [Learn Build Teach Discord](http://learnbuildteach.com) community. We have a separate channel set up specifically for the Advent of JavaScript.

# **Getting Started**

1. To get started, download the files. They includes all the project assets you need to get started: Figma file, images, and a style guide.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
4. Happy coding!
5. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofcss**

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework or libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Create a section for commenting on the featured video
- Add additional navigation to the header bar
- When the user scrolls down on the page, show the YouTube logo, as is. But, when the user scrolls up, either hide or reduce the size of the YouTube logo
